## Installation <a name="installation"></a>
I have used the following libraries: pandas, numpy, matplotlib.pyplot, seaborn, calendar, scipy.stats
The Project_I.ipynb can be run using Python 3.* versions.

## Project Motivation <a name="motivation"></a>
This project does an exploratory analysis to find out the factors that affect availability of listings on Air Bnb. We look into factors such as time of the year, ratings, neighbourhood and type of home. 

## File Descriptions <a name="files"></a>
This repository contains two components:
1.  - This file contains the data that was used to conduct the analysis. This can be found on the insider air bnb platform (http://insideairbnb.com/get-the-data/). And contains information on listings for the year 2023. 
2. Arvato Project Workbook.ipynb.ipynb (Analysis) - This is the notebook where I have pre-processed the data, and conducted my analysis, built my model.

## Results <a name="results"></a>
This analysis is presented in the form of a blog post and can be found on the following page:
