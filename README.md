The Arvato Project Workbook.ipynb can be run using Python 3.* versions.

## Project Motivation <a name="motivation"></a>
This project does an exploratory analysis into demographics of the German population versus that of a mail order sales company. It then uses unsupervised ML techniques to find out the factors make a person more likely to be a customer of the company. The second part of the project then uses supervised ML technique to build a model that predicts whether a customer should be targetted with a marketting campaign or not.

## File Descriptions <a name="files"></a>

1. Arvato Project Workbook.ipynb.ipynb (Analysis) - This is the notebook where I have pre-processed the data, and conducted my analysis, built my model.
2. DIAS Attributes_unkowns.xlsx - The excel file I used to spot columns with unkown values for preprocessing
3. DIAS Attributes - Values 2017.xlsx - File that decribes data
4. DIAS Information Levels - Attributes 2017.xlsx -  File that decribes data
